## In-Memory Rate Limit Store: `InMemoryRateLimitCounterStore`

The `InMemoryRateLimitCounterStore` provides a thread-safe, in-memory implementation to manage rate limiting data. This store is ideal for **single-instance applications** where persistence across application restarts is not required. It offers quick and easy access to rate limiting data, making it a good option for development, testing, and simple deployments.

### Features

- **Thread-Safe Access**: Utilizes a `ConcurrentDictionary` to ensure safe, simultaneous access from multiple threads.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired rate limit data is automatically removed when fetched, helping to manage memory usage without requiring manual cleanup.
- **Efficient Updates**: The `AddOrUpdate` method ensures that rate limit data is either added if new or updated if it already exists, optimizing performance and reducing overhead.


### When to Use

The `InMemoryRateLimitCounterStore` is most suitable in the following scenarios:

- **Single-Instance Applications**: If your application runs on a single server or instance, and you do not need to persist rate limit data across restarts, this in-memory approach is ideal. It is lightweight and provides fast access to data without the overhead of a distributed system.
  
- **Local Development and Testing**: For local development and testing of rate limiting logic, `InMemoryRateLimitCounterStore` is a quick and easy solution. It allows you to validate the correctness of your rate limiting strategies before deploying to production environments with distributed storage.

### Considerations for Production

While the in-memory store is useful for specific use cases, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **No Persistence**: Data is lost when the application restarts. If your system requires persistence (e.g., to maintain rate limiting data across server restarts), this approach is not suitable.
  
- **Non-Distributed**: This store is not shared between multiple instances of your application. For horizontally scaled or distributed applications, youâ€™ll need to implement `IRateLimitCounterStore` with a durable and distributed storage solution, such as:
  - **Redis**: A distributed, in-memory data store that persists data across multiple servers and is ideal for production-ready distributed rate limiting.
  - **SQL Database**: For applications where a traditional relational database is used, a SQL-based implementation can be considered.
