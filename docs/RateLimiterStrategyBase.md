## Creating Custom Rate Limiting Strategies

The `RateLimiterStrategyBase<TOptions>` class serves as a versatile foundation for designing custom rate-limiting strategies. By subclassing this base class, developers can define how their applications manage request limits using various algorithms, including **Fixed Window**, **Token Bucket**, and more.

### Example: Implementing a Fixed Window Strategy

Here is an example of how to implement a fixed window rate-limiting strategy by extending `RateLimiterStrategyBase`:

```csharp
public class FixedWindowRateStrategy : RateLimiterStrategyBase<FixedWindowOptions>
{
    private readonly IRateLimitCounterStore _counterStore;

    public FixedWindowRateStrategy(IRateLimitCounterStore counterStore, FixedWindowOptions options)
        : base(counterStore, options)
    {
        _counterStore = counterStore;
    }

    public override async Task<bool> IsRequestPermittedAsync(string key, DateTime asOfDate)
    {
        var currentCount = await _counterStore.GetRequestCountAsync(key, asOfDate);
        if (currentCount < Options.RequestLimit)
        {
            await _counterStore.IncrementRequestCountAsync(key, asOfDate);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Key Components

- **Options**: The generic type `TOptions` allows you to configure the rate-limiting strategy. For a fixed window strategy, this might include parameters such as the duration of the time window and the maximum number of requests permitted within that window.
  
- **IRateLimitCounterStore**: This interface is utilized to maintain and track the count of requests, enabling the strategy to determine if a client has exceeded the established limits.

### Customizing Rate Limiting Logic

By extending `RateLimiterStrategyBase`, you can implement various rate-limiting algorithms. Some potential strategies include:

- **Sliding Window**: This approach involves tracking the timestamps of requests to maintain a sliding window, thereby allowing requests to be counted continuously over time.

- **Leaky Bucket**: In this strategy, requests "leak" from the bucket at a constant rate, effectively smoothing out bursts of traffic while accommodating temporary surges in usage.

Inheriting from the base class ensures that your custom strategies integrate smoothly with the libraryâ€™s overall architecture, making them straightforward to manage and apply across your application.
