## Redis Rate Limit Store: `RedisRateLimitCounterStore`

The `RedisRateLimitCounterStore` class implements the `IRateLimitCounterStore` interface, utilizing Redis to manage rate limiting data. This implementation enables persistent and distributed rate limiting, making it particularly suitable for applications running across multiple instances.

### Features
- **Redis Integration**: Leverages Redis for data storage, ensuring persistence across application restarts.
- **Distributed Access**: Allows multiple instances of an application to share and access rate limit data seamlessly.
- **JSON Serialization**: Utilizes JSON for storing and retrieving rate limit data, simplifying the handling of complex data structures.


### When to Use
- **Distributed Applications**: This store is ideal for applications that are deployed across multiple servers or instances, requiring a shared state for rate limiting.
- **Persistent Data Requirements**: Use this implementation in scenarios where you need rate limit data to persist beyond application restarts or deployments.

### Prerequisites
- **Redis Server**: Ensure that a Redis server is running and accessible from your application environment. You can configure the connection string as needed to connect to your Redis instance.
