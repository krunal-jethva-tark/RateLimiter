## Combining Rate Limiting Strategies

In some cases, you might want to combine multiple rate limiting strategies to provide more flexibility and control. For instance, you can apply a **Fixed Window** strategy to control overall traffic and a **Token Bucket** strategy to handle burst traffic more gracefully.

### Example: Combining Fixed Window and Token Bucket

```csharp
// Combine Fixed Window and Token Bucket Strategies
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRateLimiter(registry =>
    {
        // Fixed Window Policy
        registry.AddFixedWindowPolicy("FixedWindowPolicy", options =>
        {
            options.Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
            options.PermitLimit = 100;
        });

        // Token Bucket Policy for bursty traffic
        registry.AddTokenBucketPolicy("TokenBucketPolicy", options =>
        {
            options.TokenLimit = 100;      // Max burst capacity
            options.RefillRate = 10;       // Tokens refilled per second
            options.PermitLimit = 10;      // Max requests per second
        });
    });
}
```

### How it Works

- **Fixed Window**: Limits the overall number of requests within a given window.
- **Token Bucket**: Allows clients to accumulate unused requests (tokens) and submit bursts of traffic within the specified burst capacity.

By combining these two strategies, you ensure that traffic is controlled both in terms of total volume and short bursts, providing a balanced and flexible rate limiting solution.

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Per-User, Per-IP, and Per-Service Rate Limiting

You can configure rate limiting strategies based on specific criteria, such as per user, per IP address, or per service. This allows for more granular control over who or what is consuming your API resources.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRateLimiter(registry =>
    {
        // Per-User Rate Limiting
        registry.AddFixedWindowPolicy("UserPolicy", options =>
        {
            options.PermitLimit = 100;
            options.Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
        }).ForUser();

        // Per-IP Rate Limiting
        registry.AddFixedWindowPolicy("IPPolicy", options =>
        {
            options.PermitLimit = 50;
            options.Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
        }).ForIP();

        // Per-Service Rate Limiting
        registry.AddTokenBucketPolicy("ServicePolicy", options =>
        {
            options.TokenLimit = 200;
            options.RefillRate = 20;
            options.PermitLimit = 20;
        }).ForService();
    });
}
```

### How it Works

- **Per-User**: Each authenticated user has their own rate limit, helping to prevent individual users from overwhelming the system.
- **Per-IP**: Requests are limited based on the clientâ€™s IP address, useful for mitigating abuse from specific IPs.
- **Per-Service**: When inter-service communication is involved, this allows each service to have its own rate limiting quota, useful in microservice architectures.

### Priority-Based Rate Limiting

Rate limits can also be configured based on the priority of the system or service. For example, higher-priority services can have a larger quota, while lower-priority systems can have a more restrictive limit.s
